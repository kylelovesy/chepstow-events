# Supabase Configuration
# Copy this file to .env.local and update with your actual Supabase project values

# Your Supabase project URL (found in Project Settings > API)
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co

# Your Supabase anon/public key (found in Project Settings > API)
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
